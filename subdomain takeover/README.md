This is a dummy subdomain takeover vulnerability scanner. It doesnt fully automate the process but gives you a good overview of the target domains that might potentially be vulnerable. The script lists out all CNAME domains pointing out to a page that retuns the 404 status code. That might be an indicator of a potential subdomain takeover but only under specific circumstances.
