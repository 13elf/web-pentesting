# Description
This tool has two different scripts which are subdomain-list.sh and domain-validator.py

# Subdomain Lister (subdomain-list.sh)
This tool is used to display all the subdomains of a given website by sending a get request to the website "crt.sh". The domains that have been found are saved in "results/subdomains.txt".

Usage:<BR>
chmod +x subdomain-list.sh<BR>
./subdomain-list.sh mydomain.com

# Domain validator (domain-validator.py)
Not all the domains listed out using the tool above will be active. Domain validator sends a get request to every subdomain and examines the response code to check if they're available. If the response code is 200, that particular subdomain is saved in "results/validated-domains.txt".

Domain validator takes two positional arguments. First one is the file name which contains all the subdomains. The second argument is the number of concurrent threads to be created. Each thread sends a get request to one single domain. As you increase the value of this thread option, script will run faster but it's recommended not to keep that value too high. When you don't specify the thread count, it defaults to 20.

usage:<BR>
chmod +x domain-validator.py<BR>
./domain-validator.py mydomain.com<BR>
OR<BR>
./domain-validator.py mydomain.com 50
