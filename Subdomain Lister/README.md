# Description
This tool has two different scripts which are subdomain-list.sh and domain-validator.py

# Subdomain Lister (subdomain-list.sh)
This tool is used to display all the subdomains of a given website by sending a get request to the website "crt.sh". The domains that have been found are saved in resutls/subdomains.txt

Usage:
chmod +x subdomain-list.sh
./subdomain-list.sh mydomain.com

# Domain validator (domain-validator.py)
Domain validator sends a get request to every subdomain and examines the response code. If it's 200, that particular subdomain is saved in results/validated-domains.txt
Domain validator takes two positional arguments. First one is the file name which contains all the subdomains. The second argument is the number of concurrent threads to be created. Each thread sends a get request to one single domain.
Note that the last argument that specifies the number of threads is options. When it's left out, it defaults to 20.

usage:
chmod +x domain-validator.py
./domain-validator.py mydomain.com
OR
./domain-validator.py mydomain.com 50
